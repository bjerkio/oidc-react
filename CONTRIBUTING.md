# Contributing to oidc-react

:+1::tada: Thanks for taking the time to contribute! :tada::+1:

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing. These are just
guidelines, not rules, so use your best judgment and feel free to propose
changes to this document in a pull request.

## Issues and Pull Requests

- If you're not sure about adding something,
  [open an issue](https://github.com/bjerkio/oidc-react/issues/new) to discuss
  it.
- Feel free to open a Pull Request early so that a discussion can be had as
  changes are developed.

## Commit Messages and Pull Request Titles

We use the
[Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/)
specification to standardize our commit history. To enforce this convention on
commit messages and/or pull request titles, we use the
[Semantic Pull Requests](https://github.com/probot/semantic-pull-requests) bot.

The commit message summary (or pull request title) is constructed by prepending
the type of change being made (e.g., feat, fix, refactor), followed by an
imperative, present tense sentence (without a period). Example:
`fix: make header bold`.

If you are still working on your pull request, prepend `WIP:` to indicate that
it's work in progress.

### Pull Request Title

Same as commit messages, prepend the type of change being made (refactor, fix,
chore, feat, etc.) Example: `docs: add linux setup instructions`

## Documentation

Most of the documentation are automatically generated. We utilize `typedoc` that
uses tags inline with classes in order to generate. The nice thing about this is
that documentation will be visible when using Typescript in editors as well.

However, we love to have examples and guides as well.

## Need Help?

If any of this information confusing, incorrect, or incomplete, feel free to
[open an issue](https://github.com/bjerkio/oidc-react/issues/new) for help.
